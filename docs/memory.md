# Memory

*This document contains high-priority active context that every new chat must read carefully.*

Phase 1 is complete
Before you commit, make sure build and test succeed
Don't create a Markdown doc without asking me first
Commit your changes by default in a new chat, until I tell you to 'stop committing until I verify the fix', but you're allowed to resume committing your changes when I tell you we're in "implementation mode"; Implementation mode (default) = commit, Troubleshooting mode = don't
Refer to Architecture.md for application architecture when needed, and PRD.md when context around what we're building is needed
Do not read anything in docs/chat-logs/
